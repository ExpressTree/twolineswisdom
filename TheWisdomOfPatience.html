    <h2>The Transformation of Theo</h2>

    <p>In the same forest where Chirpy the sparrow, Skyler the blue jay, and Ember the robin lived, there was a small caterpillar named Theo. Theo was tiny, with green and yellow stripes along his body. He often felt overlooked by the other creatures, who could fly, sing, or run faster than him. Theo dreamed of becoming something greater, something that would make the forest notice him.</p>

    <p>One day, Theo saw Chirpy flying high and chirping happily. “Chirpy,” Theo asked, “how do you do such amazing things? I wish I could fly like you.”</p>

    <p>Chirpy landed near Theo and said, “You will find your way, Theo, but everything happens in its time. Be patient.”</p>

    <p>Theo wasn’t satisfied with that answer. “Patience?” he muttered. “That sounds boring.”</p>

    <p>Feeling unsure, Theo decided to rest. Days turned into weeks, and Theo noticed his body beginning to change. He felt strange but safe, wrapped in a cocoon he hadn’t even realized he had made. “What is happening to me?” Theo wondered.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Inside the cocoon, Theo waited. It was quiet and still, and he had no idea what was coming. At first, the waiting felt endless, but over time, Theo began to understand that patience was part of the journey.</p>

    </div>

    <p>One morning, the cocoon began to crack. Slowly, Theo emerged. He stretched his legs and felt something new—wings! Bright, colorful wings that shimmered in the sunlight. Theo had become a butterfly.</p>
