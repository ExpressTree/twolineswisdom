    <h2>Ember Finds Her Song</h2>

    <p>In the vibrant forest where Chirpy the sparrow and Skyler the blue jay lived, there was another bird named Ember, a robin. Ember was shy and quiet, often feeling like she didn’t belong among the other birds. She loved to sing, but unlike Skyler’s loud, boastful chirps or the joyful tunes of other birds, Ember’s songs were soft and delicate.</p>

    <p>One sunny morning, Ember sat alone on a low branch, watching Chirpy glide gracefully through the trees. “I wish I could be more like Chirpy,” she sighed. She tried to mimic his flight, flapping her wings quickly and swooping down like he did, but she lost her balance and tumbled into a bush.</p>

    <p>Ember felt embarrassed. Later, she saw Skyler soaring high in the sky, his shiny blue feathers catching the sunlight. “Maybe I should be bold like Skyler,” she thought. She climbed to a high branch and spread her wings to soar like him, but a sudden gust of wind made her lose her footing, and she barely managed to land safely.</p>

    <p>Encouraged by Chirpy’s words, Ember decided to try singing her own song the next morning. She perched on a branch overlooking a quiet clearing, her heart pounding with nervousness. Closing her eyes, she began to sing softly. Her melody floated through the forest, weaving between the trees like a gentle breeze.</p>

    <p>To her surprise, the other birds stopped to listen. Skyler landed nearby, his head tilted as he listened to her song. “That’s… amazing,” he said. “I’ve never heard anything like it.”</p>

    <p>From that day, Ember stopped trying to imitate others. She sang her own songs, filling the forest with her unique melodies. She realized that being herself was her greatest strength and that courage meant embracing who she truly was.</p>
