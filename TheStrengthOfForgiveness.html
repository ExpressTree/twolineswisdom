					<h1>The Strength of Forgiveness</h1>
					<h2>A Story About Skyler and Flopsy</h2>
					<p>The forest was buzzing with excitement as the animals prepared for the annual games. Skyler the blue jay and Flopsy the rabbit had always been the best of friends, and they were excited to compete together in the relay race.</p>
					<p>However, as they practiced, an accident occurred. Skyler had misjudged his flight and accidentally knocked over the baton Flopsy was holding, causing it to fall into a muddy puddle.</p>
					<p>“You ruined it!” Flopsy yelled, his ears drooping in frustration.</p>
					<p>“It was an accident!” Skyler replied defensively.</p>
					<p>The two friends argued, and their once happy bond felt broken. “I don’t want to race with you anymore,” Flopsy said, hopping away angrily.</p>
					<p>Skyler felt hurt and flew off to sit alone on a high branch.</p>

						<p>The next day, the forest felt different. Skyler and Flopsy avoided each other, and the other animals noticed.</p>
						<p>“What happened between you two?” Ria the fox asked Flopsy.</p>
						<p>“Skyler doesn’t care about our practice,” Flopsy said, his voice tinged with anger.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Skyler told Chirpy, “I didn’t mean to mess up, but Flopsy didn’t even listen to me.”</p>
						<p>The animals felt sad to see their friends upset. Ria decided to bring them together to talk.</p>

						<p>Ria approached Flopsy later that day. “Do you think Skyler ruined the practice on purpose?”</p>
						<p>Flopsy hesitated. “No… but it still hurt that he wasn’t careful.”</p>
						<p>“Maybe talking to him will help,” Ria suggested.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Chirpy said to Skyler, “You and Flopsy have been friends for so long. Don’t you want to make things right?”</p>
						<p>Skyler sighed. “I do, but what if he’s still angry?”</p>
						<p>Both friends spent the evening thinking about how much they missed each other.</p>

							<p>The next morning, Ria called Skyler and Flopsy to meet by the river. “You two need to talk,” she said firmly.</p>
							<p>Skyler stepped forward. “Flopsy, I’m really sorry for what happened. It was my fault, and I should’ve been more careful.”</p>
							<p>Flopsy looked at Skyler for a moment. “I was upset, but… I shouldn’t have yelled at you. I forgive you, Skyler.”</p>
							<p>The two friends smiled at each other, feeling a weight lifted off their shoulders.</p>

								<p>With their friendship restored, Skyler and Flopsy practiced together once more. On the day of the games, they worked as a team and won the relay race, bringing cheers from all the animals.</p>
								<p>“Forgiveness is powerful,” Flopsy said. “It’s better to forgive than to stay angry.”</p>
								<p>Skyler nodded. “I’m glad we worked through it. You’re my best friend, Flopsy.”</p>
								<p>The forest was filled with joy as the two friends celebrated with their teammates, their bond stronger than ever.</p>
