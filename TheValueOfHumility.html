    <h1>The Value of Humility</h1>
    <h2>Skyler Learns a Lesson</h2>

    <p>In the same forest where Chirpy the sparrow lived, there was another bird named Skyler, a blue jay. Skyler was strong and fast, and he loved to show off his skills. He would fly higher than the other birds, sing louder, and even boast about how shiny his blue feathers were.</p>

    <p>One day, Skyler saw Chirpy flying close to the ground, practicing a gentle glide. Skyler chuckled and said, “Why are you wasting your time flying so low? Look at me! I can soar to the tallest branches without any effort.”</p>

    <p>Chirpy, who had learned the value of focus from his adventures, simply replied, “Every flight has its purpose, Skyler. You’ll understand one day.”</p>

    <p>Skyler decided he wanted to prove he was the best bird in the forest. “I’ll show everyone just how amazing I am,” he thought. The next morning, he called all the birds to watch him perform. “Gather around!” he chirped. “I’m going to fly to the top of the tallest tree and back before any of you can blink.”</p>

    <p>The other birds gathered to watch. Chirpy, sitting quietly among them, said, “Good luck, Skyler. Remember, the tallest trees often have the strongest winds.”</p>

    <p>Skyler scoffed. “Winds can’t stop me. I’m the best!” With that, he flapped his wings and soared into the sky.</p>

    <p>Skyler flew higher and higher, but as he neared the tallest tree, a sudden storm rolled in. The winds grew fierce, and Skyler struggled to stay steady. His feathers, once shiny and neat, were now ruffled and damp. He tried to push forward, but the wind was too strong. Exhausted, he had to perch on a nearby branch to catch his breath.</p>

    <p>Down below, Chirpy and the other birds watched in silence. Chirpy felt worried for Skyler but knew this was a lesson he needed to learn.</p>

    <p>When the storm calmed, Skyler slowly flew back down. His wings were heavy, and his pride was bruised. He landed near Chirpy and the others, feeling embarrassed. “I couldn’t do it,” he admitted softly. “The wind was too strong.”</p>

    <p>Chirpy hopped closer and said, “It’s okay, Skyler. Even the strongest birds need to know their limits. Humility helps us grow. Instead of showing off, use your strength to help others.”</p>

    <p>Skyler nodded, realizing his mistake. “I was so focused on proving myself that I forgot the value of being humble. Thank you, Chirpy.”</p>

    </div>

    <p>From that day, Skyler became a different bird. Instead of boasting, he used his speed and strength to help the other birds. Whether guiding them during storms or carrying twigs for nests, Skyler learned the joy of serving others. He still flew high sometimes, but now it was with purpose and not pride.</p>
