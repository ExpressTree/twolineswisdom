    <h1>The Art of Letting Go</h1>
    <h2>Niko Learns to Be Free</h2>

    <p>In the vibrant forest where Chirpy the sparrow, Skyler the blue jay, Ember the robin, and Theo the butterfly lived, there was a curious monkey named Niko. Niko loved collecting things. His small nest in the treetop was filled with shiny stones, colorful leaves, and even nuts he never ate. The other animals admired Niko’s cleverness and energy, but they often noticed his frustration. He never seemed happy, always looking for more.</p>

    <p>One day, while searching for treasures, Niko spotted a glimmering golden nut stuck inside a hollow tree trunk. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen! “I must have it,” he thought, squeezing his hand inside the small hole.</p>

    <p>Niko tugged and pulled, but the harder he held onto the nut, the more stuck his hand became. Chirpy flew over and perched nearby. “Niko, why don’t you let go of the nut?” Chirpy asked.</p>

    <p>Taking a deep breath, Niko slowly opened his hand. The golden nut slipped back into the tree. Instantly, his hand came free. Niko looked at Chirpy and said, “You were right. I was holding on to something I didn’t need.”</p>

    <p>The next day, Niko decided to share his treasures with the other animals, giving them colorful leaves and shiny stones. The forest came alive with joy as Niko learned that sharing brought him more happiness than collecting ever did.</p>
