    <h1>The Courage to Be Honest</h1>
    <h2>A Story About Lila the Turtle</h2>

    <p>In the serene forest, there was a shy little turtle named Lila. Lila loved her quiet life near the river, but she often struggled to speak up. She was kind-hearted but feared that telling the truth might hurt someone or cause problems.</p>

<p>One bright morning, Lila heard her friends laughing by the river. When she reached them, she saw Flopsy, Chirpy, Skyler, and Ria playing with a shiny golden ball they had found. “Look what we discovered!” Chirpy chirped excitedly.</p>

<p>“That’s beautiful!” Lila said, admiring the ball from a distance.</p>

<p>The group decided to play a game of catch with the ball. As they tossed it back and forth, Lila stayed on the sidelines, watching nervously.</p>

<p>Flopsy threw the ball with great enthusiasm, but it bounced off a rock and rolled toward the river. Before anyone could stop it, the ball slipped into the water and sank.</p>

<p>“Oh no!” Flopsy exclaimed. “What will we do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and get it,” Skyler said confidently, but the river was too deep, and Skyler couldn’t reach it.</p>

<p>The group looked at each other, unsure of what to do. Lila stayed quiet, but she had seen where the ball had fallen.</p>

---

<p>As her friends debated what to do, Lila felt a heavy weight in her chest. She had seen exactly where the ball had fallen, but she was scared to speak up. What if they blamed her for not acting sooner?</p>

<p>“It’s just a ball,” Ria said. “Maybe we should move on.”</p>

<p>Lila opened her mouth to speak but hesitated. Her heart raced as she thought, “If I tell them, what if they’re upset with me?”</p>

</div>

<p>Lila stayed quiet for a moment longer, feeling torn between her fear and the desire to help her friends. She remembered Bala’s wise words: “Being honest, even when it’s hard, shows true strength.”</p>

<p>Finally, Lila took a deep breath and decided to speak up.</p>

---

<p>Lila took a deep breath and said, “I... I saw where the ball fell. I think I can get it.”</p>

<p>The group turned to her, surprised but supportive. “That’s great, Lila! You’re the only one who can help,” Flopsy said.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her friends, Lila carefully swam into the river. She dived down, using her strong shell to push past the current. After a few moments, she spotted the ball wedged between two rocks. With determination, she pulled it free and swam back to the surface.</p>

<p>When Lila emerged from the water with the golden ball, her friends erupted in cheers. “You did it, Lila!” Chirpy chirped.</p>

<p>“Thank you for being honest and brave,” Ria said. “We would’ve never found it without you.”</p>

<p>Lila smiled shyly but felt a surge of pride. “I was scared, but I’m glad I told you the truth.”</p>

---

<p>Ria added, “Your honesty showed us how much you care about us.”</p>

<p>The group continued playing with the ball, and this time, Lila joined in. She felt lighter and happier, knowing that being honest had brought her closer to her friends.</p>

<p>From that day on, Lila learned that honesty and courage made her not only stronger but also more connected to her friends. She realized that even small acts of truth could create big changes in her life.</p>

### **Moral**
<p>Honesty takes courage, but it builds trust and strengthens friendships. Speaking the truth, even when it’s hard, is always the right choice.</p>
